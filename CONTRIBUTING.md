# Contributing
You can contribute in two ways 
## Code
If you feel confident with coding or just want to learn and try to help you're welcome !

Just fork the repository, clone it and start coding. \
You can then submit a pull request [here](https://github.com/Hokkaydo/MoodleCustomizer/pulls). 

Don't hesitate to submit your code, even if you aren't sure it is the best in the world. Nobody would blame you for trying to help

## Issues : suggestions and bug reports
If you don't want to code, you can still help by providing feedback in the issues [section](https://github.com/Hokkaydo/MoodleCustomizer/issues).\
Some templates are already set up but you can still create a blank issue if none match your request. 

## In the end
No matter how, no matter how much you help, it will always make this ~shit~ project go further
